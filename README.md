## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Lead-to-Delivery funnel** for ElectricPe to uncover business insights, operational bottlenecks, and customer sentiment trends.  
The dashboard visualizes lead conversions, delivery turnaround times (TAT), cancellation reasons, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) using **Excel** and **Power BI**.

- Track **conversion performance** across city stores.  
- Identify **reasons for cancellations and delivery delays**.  
- Measure **customer satisfaction (NPS)** and follow-up efficiency.  
- Enable **faster decision-making** through visual analytics.

## 📈 Dashboard Insights

### 🔹 Lead Conversion
- Overall conversion rate: **81.2%**
- Top performing store: **Mumbai MBC (82.06%)**
- Key Issue: Around 1 in 5 leads drop before pre-booking due to delayed follow-ups.

### 🔹 Delivery Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Average TAT: **4.5 days**, exceeding the 3-day benchmark.  
- Delays mainly occur during the **final delivery stage** — coordination gaps between store and logistics.

### 🔹 Cancellations
- **27% of leads cancelled**.  
- Top reasons:  
  - Price Sensitivity (61 cases)  
  - Financing Issues (59 cases)  
- Indicates affordability challenges and lack of re-engagement for dropped leads.

### 🔹 Customer Satisfaction (NPS)
- Overall **NPS = –53.50%**.  
- Customers followed up **within 7 days** rated 8.1/10 vs. 5.9/10 for delayed follow-ups.  
- Timely follow-ups significantly improve satisfaction.
